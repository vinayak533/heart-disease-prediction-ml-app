❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Web App

A machine learning web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters.
This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the final model and is deployed using Streamlit Cloud.

📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction can help with timely treatment and prevention.
This project analyzes patient health data — such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, and more — to predict the risk of heart disease.
